                My dear love, how you shine so bright, <br>
                No matter the distance we sit apart, <br>
                Our hearts meet to dance in the dead of night, <br>
                I gaze out my window to admire our art.<br>
                <br>
                The way I long for you after you shut your eyes, <br>
                Your lovely voice; my only lullaby, <br>
                My only warmth in this world of ice, <br>
                I'd cry a river so you could fly. <br>
                <br>
                But when morning meets; your spectrum greets, <br>
                My eyes filled with your rainbow shine, <br>
                Your words make my heart skip beats, <br>
                How could I ever deserve you, my divine? <br>
                <br>
                Take my hand and let's promise our devotion, <br>
                Let's let our love embrace forever in our ocean. <br>
